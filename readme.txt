Project Description: 
The term project is called "112Â° Cooked" and it simulates the game "Overcooked". The project is a game where you can control a chef to make food in a kitchen. There are two food (salad and hamburger) each with three different ingredients (lettuce, tomato, cucumber and bun, cheese, beef, respectively). To make each type of food, the player is required to complete certain preparation steps. There are orders that are randomly generated and are passed in to the chef. The orders need to be completed under a certain amount of time, or the order would be considered as failed. The score earned for each order is calculated based on the time left when the chef completes the order. There is also an AI mouse that runs to the ingredient counter and steals a type of ingredient. Each time an ingredient is stolen points are deducted from the total score. After a certain amount of time has passed, the game ends and the total score is reported on the screen. 

How to run the project:
The file that the user should run in an editor is the file named "termProject.py". All the other files that are needed to run the game are included in the tp3 folder. When running the project, all the files should be kept in the same folder. 

There are no libraries used in this project. 

Shortcut Commands:
